# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

A simple Python project that predicts whether a movie review is **positive** or **negative** using **word frequency counting**.  
The project also includes a **random dataset generator**, which automatically creates positive and negative reviews every time the program runs.

This project is designed for beginners and follows the requirements of the VITyarthi – Build Your Own Project guidelines.

## How It Works (In Simple Words)

1. The program creates random positive and negative movie reviews.  
2. It counts how many times each word appears in positives vs negatives.  
3. The user enters a review.  
4. The system checks the words and compares frequencies.  
5. Output = **positive**, **negative**, or **cannot decide**.
